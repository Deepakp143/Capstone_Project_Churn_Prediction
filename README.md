Project: Customer Churn Prediction
Industry: Telecom

1. Project Overview

The "Customer Churn Prediction" project aims to develop a predictive model for identifying potential churn among telecom customers. The project's objective is to predict customer churn based on historical purchase data, customer interactions, and other relevant features. By analyzing factors that contribute to churn, the goal is to enhance customer retention strategies and reduce churn rates. The outcome of the project will be a predictive model that aids in proactive customer retention efforts and increases overall customer satisfaction.

2. Objectives

Develop a predictive model capable of identifying potential customer churn.
Enhance customer retention by identifying customers at risk of leaving the platform.
Utilize machine learning algorithms and feature engineering to improve prediction accuracy.
Incorporate customer interactions, purchase history, and other features to capture churn patterns.
Optimize customer retention strategies and improve the overall customer experience.
3. Scope

The project encompasses the following aspects:

Data Collection: Gather historical customer purchase data, interaction history, and customer attributes.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess collected data, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
Feature Engineering: Engineer relevant features that capture customer behavior, purchase patterns, and interactions.
Model Development: Utilize machine learning algorithms to build the customer churn prediction model.
Validation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Data Sources

The project will require data from the following sources:

Historical customer purchase data, including transaction amounts, timestamps, and products purchased.
Interaction history, such as website visits, clicks, and engagement with marketing campaigns.
Customer attributes like demographics, location, and purchase history.
5. Methodology
